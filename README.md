# Physics

## Purpose
Basically, I'm learning R and I have a love for Physics, so I decided to create a group of physics related calculations. Nothing in it is groundbreaking and there are probably dozens of other packages that already do all of this and more. But, hey, it's free, so use it! Or don't. It's up to you!

## Contributing
If you do find this interesting, feel free to contribute. Most of it is very self evident, but just a word on styling: I use equal signs for setting variables and left arrows for assigning functions. For naming, I use dot naming, all starting with "physics" to keep it clean.

## Usage
Set your working directory to the folder with physics.r in it. Run source("physics.r"), it will load all other files. After that, everything is in the "physics" virtual namespace. Additionally, feel free to add anything you'd like to the "precalculated.r" file, as the name implies it's for precalculated values, you can modify it however you'd like to store values you think you'll want to use often.
